About the project -:
This is project is used to convert a specific word into color for e.g. if you type Rainbow then it will show all the colors of rainbow etc.

For this project I have used Angular version 12.

I have created a seprate service in this angular project named color-script.js. If you want to use that service you have to just import that script and then you can use that service functions.

I have also created responsive mysonry layout to show colors in a grid. I also show colors hexavalue on each grid.

In the project you can also call your api to fetch data and then show data as per requirement.Currently I am using dummy json file so that if you type rainbow it will fetch data from that json **(defaultColor.json)** and bind all colors releated to rainbow and show on front end.

I also commented for each function so that any new member can understand and use that service function in his/her project.

That service convert word into following -
Rgb	
Hex
Hsl
Hwb
Cmyk
Ncol
